# Trading212 Portfolio Analysis Tool - Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

This project is a comprehensive portfolio analysis tool that integrates with Trading212 to fetch portfolio positions and enhance them with financial data from multiple providers (Alpha Vantage, Tiingo). The tool provides detailed insights including sector allocation, risk analysis, and performance monitoring while maintaining robust API limits management to ensure reliable operation within free tier constraints.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **API Rate Limits**: Multiple providers with different rate limiting schemes (Alpha Vantage: 25/day + 5/min, Tiingo: 1000/day + 50/hour)
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring comprehensive coverage across different ticker formats and exchanges
- **User Experience**: Providing insights without exposing users to technical API constraints
- **Performance**: Efficient caching and fallback strategies to maintain responsiveness
- **Educational**: Making complex API management transparent and educational for users

## Lessons

- **Help System Design**: Contextual help works best when it's non-intrusive but easily discoverable. The small help icons with rich tooltips provide the right balance.

- **Educational Content**: Users prefer step-by-step explanations with real-world examples rather than technical documentation. The FAQ format works particularly well for complex concepts.

- **Real-time Integration**: Showing live API status in help content makes the information more relevant and actionable for users.

- **Component Reusability**: Building flexible, configurable help components allows for easy expansion across the entire application without code duplication.

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Starting with basic help and allowing users to dive deeper (via "Learn More" links) prevents information overload while serving different user needs.

- **Mobile Considerations**: Help tooltips need careful positioning on mobile devices to avoid blocking content or going off-screen.
