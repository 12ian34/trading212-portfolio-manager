# Trading212 Portfolio Analysis Tool - Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

This project is a comprehensive portfolio analysis tool that integrates with Trading212 to fetch portfolio positions and enhance them with financial data from multiple providers (Alpha Vantage, Tiingo). The tool provides detailed insights including sector allocation, risk analysis, and performance monitoring while maintaining robust API limits management to ensure reliable operation within free tier constraints.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **API Rate Limits**: Multiple providers with different rate limiting schemes (Alpha Vantage: 25/day + 5/min, Tiingo: 1000/day + 50/hour)
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring comprehensive coverage across different ticker formats and exchanges
- **User Experience**: Providing insights without exposing users to technical API constraints
- **Performance**: Efficient caching and fallback strategies to maintain responsiveness
- **Educational**: Making complex API management transparent and educational for users

The removal was selective and surgical, ensuring that while the educational components are gone, the underlying API management system remains robust and fully functional.

### DOM Nesting Validation Error Fix - ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue Identified**: React DOM validation error caused by invalid HTML nesting - Button components nested inside other Button components in the ContextualHelpDemo.

**Root Cause**: The ContextualHelp component always rendered a Button element, but was being used inside other Button components in the demo, creating button-inside-button nesting which violates HTML semantics.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Added `asChild` prop** to ContextualHelpProps interface to control rendering behavior
2. **Enhanced ContextualHelp component** to conditionally render as either a Button or span element based on asChild prop
3. **Updated ContextualHelpDemo** to use `asChild={true}` when QuickHelp components are nested inside buttons
4. **Maintained backward compatibility** - existing usage without asChild prop continues to work as before

**Technical Details**:
- When `asChild={false}` (default): Renders as Button with full interactive capabilities
- When `asChild={true}`: Renders as span with appropriate styling and event handlers
- QuickHelp component automatically forwards asChild prop through `
